WIP Map Viewer for Project 1999 Green, made using OpenSeaDragon. Only the Cobalt Scar map is implemented at the moment,
but I hope to eventually cover all of Norrath.


Current features:

-Click to drag the map around inside the window, zoom with mouse wheel

-Map coordinates relative to your mouse cursor displayed to the left (for easier in-game navigation)

WIP:

-Bullet points with overlays that reveal more information about the location the mouse is hovering over

-Mob spawn points, filter points based on mob name, level range, etc.

-Quest information, objective pathing

-Make the site look better in general
